1. Please find the list of smart contracts need to be auditted at readme_for_auditors.txt
(Some smart contracts are obsolete. In this revision, we deleted them)

2. Bugs
2.1. Critical issues

2.1.1. Closable: close(...)
Fixed: public -> internal

2.1.2. MozoSaleToken: onlySameChain(...)
Fixed: Refactor -> MozoSaleToken maintains the list of sale contracts

2.2. Medium severity issues

2.2.1. RevocableVested: revoke(...) 
This contract is used for vested tokens for employee. Our requirement is the owner can stop vested contract if employee quits company.

2.2.2. MozoSaleToken: release(...)
This is our requirement because the sale may reach hardcap or owner can release ICO any time

2.2.3. Sale
2.2.3.1. withdraw(...)
This function used for withdraw accidentally ETH in smart contract. We think with fallback function, this smart contract never has positive balance.
2.2.3.2. returnToken(...)
This is our requirement. Owner can get tokens back for private sale.

2.3. Documentation mismatch
We think owner and co-onwer should be fair and have the reponsibility with thirdparty/settle bank 's auditing. Our requirement is owner and co-owner can transfer tokens to private sale.

2.4. Possible front-running
MozoSaleToken: addAddressToWhitelist(...)
Fixed: We change our process & code:
- Co-owners and sale smart contracts can receive large amount of tokens
- Investor in whitelist can receive large amount of tokens
- Investor in whitelist can transfer large amount of tokens (After buying, they can transfer to anyone)

2.5. Low severity issues

2.5.1. MozoSaleToken

5.1.1. bonusToken(...)
This function is used for batch transferring bonus. We dont check AML-KYC for bonus tokens.

5.1.2. validOwner(...)
Referral is obsolete.

2.6. Redundant

2.6.1. Constructors: Fixed (excluded MozoToken.sol because it was deployed on mainnet)

2.6.2. Referral: obsolete

2.6.3. Timeline: may be used in future

2.6.4. MozoSaleToken: 
import "./Upgradable.sol"; -> Fixed
transferredIndex = i - 1;  -> Fixed
return false;              -> Keep logic because transfer return bool

2.6.5. Sale
ICO public smzoToken; uint public sold; -> Fixed
ret                                     -> Keep logic because transfer return bool

2.6.6. RevocableVested
if (token > total)         -> Fixed

2.6.7. Agency: obsolete

2.6.8. ContributionBonus: Fixed

2.6.9. TimelineBonus: obsolete

2.6.10. RevocableVested: Fixed

2.6.11. Fallback default for 0.4.0 : Fixed

2.6.12. MozoSaleToken: onlyWhitelisted(...) -> may be used in future

2.7. Visibility level: Fixed

2.8. Not implemented functionality
Beside smart contracts, we defined the process for ICO team. They are some steps need to be done manually so we did not implement them in smart contracts

2.9. Fallback function abuse: Fixed

2.10. Deploy & test script: Fixed.
Note: we had the test cases and performed the testing on our ICO DApp so we develop a simple deployment & test script only.
